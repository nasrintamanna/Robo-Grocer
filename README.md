# Robo-Grocer

This is an interactive one or two- worded grocery list generating programmed system called “Robo - grocer” to assist users in storing their grocery list items interactively. This program will initially allow for the storage of three top grocery items on the user's list but the system
can be extended to store more grocery items in the future. The robo - grocer is also be able to take screenshots of the grocery items that the user would like to buy for reference based on the website URL addresses the user enters. These screenshots will be stored in a file on the user's computer. 
The robo grocer system also allow users to make changes to the grocery item names(which are either one or two-worded) they have entered by changing the first or second word of the grocery item name before finally getting their grocery list typed and stored automatically in the Notepad for final use.
